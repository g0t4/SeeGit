# SeeGit - The Git Repository Visualizer

This is a little experiment in creating a realtime git repository visualizer.

__WARNING: This is some haacky code. I plan to rewrite it later. It's a proof of
 concept__

## Update notes

I'd like to port this to net8+, here are some observations:

- Rx extensions are using very basic Observable,Throttle,Where methods and that's about it, so shouldn't be a problem to move to actual reactive lib (instead of Rx_Experimental-Main which is delisted)
- DotNetExtensions-Base should work fine with netstandard/shims (very basics of BCL net fwk)
- LibGit2Sharp has arm and xplat builds and binaries so good to go there, all for like net8
- GraphSharp has ports too?
	- Using GraphShape 1.2.1 and its working so far
	- https://www.nuget.org/packages/GraphSharp.Core
	- etc (check nuget)
- QuickGraph has several ports (heavy usage):
	- USING https://www.nuget.org/packages/QuikGraph
	- https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sandwych.QuickGraph.Core
- WPF xplat => MAUI?

## Goal
I just want something that I can use during presentations on Git. So as I run
commands, it'll show the git graph in a beautiful manner.

# Next steps
* Need to allow you to select a repository to point at. It's currently hard
coded.
* I need to add local and remote branch annotations.
