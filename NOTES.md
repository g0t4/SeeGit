## TODOs

- upgrade to newer version of LibGit2Sharp nuget package, 0.10.0 that I am using now uses Tools/install.ps1 approach with nuget package that is dated and IIUC the newerr 0.31+ releases use dependent packages that handle the native binaries needed so I don't have to manually link in git2.dll to the build output dir (had to do this for now). BTW use amd64/git2.dll
